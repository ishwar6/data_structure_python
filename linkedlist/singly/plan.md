# Use Cases of Singly Linked Lists

## Dynamic Memory Allocation
SLLs are used in systems where the memory allocation needs to be dynamic, as they can easily adjust their size without reallocating the entire structure.

## Implementation of Stacks and Queues
SLLs can be used to implement stacks and queues efficiently. For stacks, nodes are added and removed from the head, while for queues, nodes are added at the end and removed from the head.

## Undo Functionality in Applications
They can be used to implement undo functionality in applications, where each node represents a state of the document or a file.

## Image Viewer
In applications like an image viewer, where users can move forward and backward through images, SLLs can be used to traverse through the images.

## Browser Cache
SLLs can be used for browser caching where web pages are stored in a linked list. This allows for quick access and easy removal of least recently used pages.

## Polynomial Arithmetic
They are useful in representing and manipulating polynomials. Each node can represent a term of the polynomial.

## Real-time Multi-Tasking
SLLs are used in real-time systems for task scheduling, where tasks can be added and removed efficiently.

# Data Structure Questions on Singly Linked Lists

## Reversing a Linked List
Implement a function to reverse a singly linked list.

## Detecting a Loop
Write an algorithm to detect a cycle in a singly linked list. This is often solved using Floydâ€™s cycle-finding algorithm.

## Merging Two Sorted Lists
Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

## Finding the Middle Element
Devise an algorithm to find the middle element of a singly linked list in one pass.

## Removing Duplicates
Write a function to remove duplicate elements from an unsorted linked list.

## Nth Node from the End
Find the Nth node from the end of a linked list.

## Partitioning a List
Given a value x, partition a linked list such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

## Add Two Numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

## Intersection Point of Two Lists
Given two (possibly intersecting) singly linked lists, find the point of intersection, if they do intersect.

## Palindromic LinkedList
Check if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
