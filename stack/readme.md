# Stack Implementation in Python

This folder contains the implementation of a stack data structure in Python, along with its complexity analysis, advanced concepts, and applicable use cases.

## Complexity Analysis

The stack implementation has the following complexity:

- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Push**: O(1) - Constant time insertion at the end of the list.
  - **Pop**: O(1) - Constant time removal of the last item.
  - **Peek**: O(1) - Constant time access to the last element.
  - **Is Empty**: O(1) - Constant time check for an empty list.
  - **Size**: O(1) - Constant time retrieval of the list's length.

## Advanced Concepts

1. **Stack with Linked List**: Implementation using a linked list for efficient memory usage.
2. **Thread-Safe Stack**: Ensuring thread safety in a multithreaded environment.
3. **Min/Max Stack**: O(1) access to the minimum or maximum element in the stack.
4. **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Application in undo/redo mechanisms in software.
5. **Expression Evaluation**: Usage in evaluating arithmetic expressions and converting between infix and postfix expressions.
6. **Memory Allocation**: Role in storing information about active subroutines or functions in programming languages.
7. **Real-World Complexity Considerations**: Factors affecting practical performance, including memory allocation strategies and system architecture.
